This makes it easier for the user to distigush the files based on the names of the students. 

#### The product then opens the files of the students and looks for the .xaml.cs files which hold the code of the said students. Once it has opened the file the product looks for blank spaces, curly braces, comments ect. to ensure that it does not recognize those spaces as a something to compare with in the code. 

#### Once the product has opened it looks for the name of the student and stores. After this the product starts to look at the code in the format of strings and starts checking line by line to see which lines are the same. It compares one line at a time to all of the lines of the code of the other person. The product compares the lines of code and is able to check if any of the lines are the same for the two different students. 

#### After it has finished doing this for all of the students the program then displays for the user the students name. With this the product displays the precentage of code that it noticed was the same for the students. It displays the name of both students allowing the user to see who has cheated and how much they have cheated on the project.
